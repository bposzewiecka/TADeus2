<h1>Ontologies</h1>

The phenotypic data and list of genes used in TADeus are obtained from:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://hpo.jax.org/">Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)</a> - the ontology of phenotypic abnormalities with associated diseases and genes</li>
    <li><a href="https://omim.org/">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a> - a database containing the data of human genes and genetic disorders providing links between genetic variation and phenotype</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl Genes Database<a></li>
</ul>
